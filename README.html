    <h1>README</h1>

    <p><em>Brightness Control</em> is an utility that can save the current brightness level of
    an OS X machine and restore it at a later time.  This is particularly useful in
    the case in which a user relies on a specific brightness value of his displays,
    for example because it was set during a monitor calibration process, but he
    does not want to give up the possibility of changing it at his own will under
    some circumstances.</p>

    <h2>Usage</h2>

    <p>When the application is launched a bulb icon is added to the status bar.  The
    colour of the bulb tells the user at a glance the status of its display(s):</p>

    <ul>
        <li>If the bulb is empty (black and white), the users has not saved yet a
            brightness value.</li>
        <li>If the bulb is green, the current brightness value equals the saved one.</li>
        <li>If the bulb is yellow, the current brightness value does not equal the
            saved one.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>When the status bar icon is clicked, a contextual menu is presented to the
    user.  The following items are shown:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>A slider control, used to adjust the brightness.</li>
        <li><em>Show percentage</em>, used to display the current brightness value as a
            percentage in the status bar.</li>
        <li><em>Save</em>, used to save the current brightness value.</li>
        <li><em>Restore</em>, used to restore a previously saved brightness value.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Installation</h2>

    <p>Users should get the binary distribution of the latest release from the
    <a href="https://github.com/emcrisostomo/brightness-control">Brightness
    Control Github repository</a>.  Developers or advanced users may want to
    compile the program from the sources, in which case XCode 5 is the only
    requirement.</p>
